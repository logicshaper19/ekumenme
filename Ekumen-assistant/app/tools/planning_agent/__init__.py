"""
Planning Agent Tools Package.

This package contains all planning-related tools following the "One Tool, One Job" principle.
Each tool does ONE specific thing and does it well.

Tools:
- generate_planning_tasks_tool: Generate planning tasks with BBCH stage integration
- optimize_task_sequence_tool: Optimize task sequence with weather constraints
- calculate_planning_costs_tool: Calculate costs with regional price variations
- analyze_resource_requirements_tool: Analyze resource requirements with equipment sizing
- check_crop_feasibility_tool: Check crop feasibility with climate zone analysis

Note: GeneratePlanningReportTool was removed (meta-orchestration - agent's job)
