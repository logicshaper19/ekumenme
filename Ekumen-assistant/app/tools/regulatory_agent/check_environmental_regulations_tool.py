    Check environmental regulations for agricultural practices with comprehensive database integration.
    
    Provides detailed environmental compliance analysis including ZNT requirements from EPHY database,
    water protection regulations, biodiversity protection, air quality regulations, nitrate directive
    compliance, seasonal restrictions, and legal references.
    
    Use this tool when you need to:
    - Check if agricultural practices comply with environmental regulations
    - Get ZNT (Zone de Non-Traitement) requirements for specific products
    - Assess environmental risks of planned agricultural activities
    - Get recommendations for environmental compliance
    - Check seasonal restrictions for specific practices
    
    The tool integrates with the EPHY database to provide real-time, accurate regulatory information
    and uses advanced caching for optimal performance.
