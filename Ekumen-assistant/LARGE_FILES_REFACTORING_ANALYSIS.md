## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: High Priority Files (Weeks 1-2)
1. **Environmental Regulations Tool** - Split into domain-specific services
2. **Knowledge Base Workflow Service** - Split into workflow components

### Phase 2: Medium Priority Files (Weeks 3-4)
3. **RAG Service** - Split into specialized services
4. **Advanced LangChain Service** - Split into component services
5. **Compliance Agent** - Split into specialized components

### Phase 3: Low Priority Files (Week 5)
6. **Farm Data Agent** - Split into focused components

## Refactoring Guidelines

### 1. Maintain Backward Compatibility
- Keep existing public interfaces
- Use facade pattern for main service classes
- Gradual migration approach

### 2. Dependency Injection
- Use dependency injection for service composition
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Clear service boundaries

### 3. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each split service
- Integration tests for service composition
- Maintain existing test coverage

### 4. Documentation
- Update API documentation
- Add service-specific documentation
- Migration guides for consumers

## Benefits of Splitting

### Code Quality
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each service has one clear purpose
- **Reduced Complexity**: Smaller files are easier to understand
- **Better Testability**: Focused unit tests for each component
- **Improved Maintainability**: Changes are isolated to specific services

### Performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Services can be loaded on demand
- **Better Caching**: Service-specific caching strategies
- **Reduced Memory Footprint**: Only load needed components

### Development Experience
- **Faster IDE Performance**: Smaller files load faster
- **Better Code Navigation**: Easier to find specific functionality
- **Reduced Merge Conflicts**: Changes are isolated
- **Easier Code Reviews**: Smaller, focused changes

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Gradual Migration
- Split one service at a time
- Maintain existing interfaces
- Test thoroughly before moving to next service

### 2. Comprehensive Testing
- Unit tests for each new service
- Integration tests for service composition
- End-to-end tests for critical workflows

### 3. Documentation
- Clear migration guides
- Updated API documentation
- Service interaction diagrams

## Estimated Effort

| File | Lines | Estimated Hours | Priority |
|------|-------|----------------|----------|
| Environmental Regulations Tool | 1,281 | 16-20 hours | HIGH |
| Knowledge Base Workflow | 989 | 12-16 hours | HIGH |
| RAG Service | 943 | 10-14 hours | MEDIUM |
| Advanced LangChain Service | 940 | 10-14 hours | MEDIUM |
| Compliance Agent | 596 | 8-12 hours | MEDIUM |
| Farm Data Agent | 493 | 6-10 hours | LOW |

**Total Estimated Effort: 62-86 hours (8-11 days)**

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Environmental Regulations Tool** - Highest impact, largest file
2. **Create service interfaces** - Define clear contracts
3. **Implement one service at a time** - Gradual migration
4. **Update tests** - Ensure comprehensive coverage
5. **Update documentation** - Keep docs in sync
6. **Monitor performance** - Ensure no regressions
