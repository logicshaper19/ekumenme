# Analytics & Intelligence Dashboard Implementation Plan

## Overview
Building a three-module analytics dashboard that transforms raw interaction data into actionable business intelligence for content partners. The dashboard answers three core questions:
1. **How is my content performing?** (Performance Tab)
2. **What do my users actually need?** (Intelligence Tab)  
3. **What should I do next to maximize my impact?** (Action Plan Tab)
